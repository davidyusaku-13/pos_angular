- Authentication state management with real-time updates

🚀 Development Experience:
- Bun package manager for 3x faster installs
- Comprehensive setup instructions (setup-instructions.md)
- Database seeding script with initial data
- TypeScript strict mode with proper error handling
- Modular architecture with lazy-loaded components
- Theme-aware component development pattern

📱 User Experience:
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Intuitive navigation with sidebar menu and mobile hamburger
- Real-time data updates and authentication state management
- Form validation and error handling with theme-aware styling
- Loading states and user feedback

- Consistent visual hierarchy across all components

🔄 Migration Details:
- npm → Bun: Faster package management and builds
- Mock data → Supabase: Real database with persistence
- HTTP calls → Supabase client: Direct database queries
- Local storage → Supabase Auth: Secure authentication
- Static data → Dynamic seeding: Database population scripts
- SVG icons → PrimeIcons: Consistent iconography system
- Static theming → Dynamic theming: Light/dark mode with persistence

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Authentication now requires Supabase account setup
- All data now persists in Supabase database
- Package manager changed from npm to Bun
- Environment variables required for configuration
- UI now requires theme service for proper styling

Closes: Advanced POS system with theming, authentication fixes, and PrimeIcons integration
