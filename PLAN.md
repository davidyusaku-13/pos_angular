# POS System Plan for Indonesian Wholesale Stores (Toko Grosir)

## Business Requirements Analysis
- **Target Market**: Indonesian wholesale stores (toko grosir) dealing with bulk products, multiple suppliers, and high-volume transactions
- **Key Pain Points**: Manual inventory tracking, cash-only transactions, lack of sales analytics, supplier management challenges
- **Business Goals**: Increase efficiency by 40%, reduce inventory errors by 60%, improve customer satisfaction through faster checkout
- **User Roles**: Store owner, cashier, inventory manager, supplier
- **Compliance**: Indonesian tax regulations (PPN), local business licensing

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Angular 20 with PrimeNG component library for responsive, enterprise-grade UI
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express or NestJS for API development
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, with potential Redis for caching
- **Deployment**: Docker containers, cloud hosting (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- **Integrations**: Payment gateways (GoPay, OVO, BCA), barcode scanners, thermal printers
- **Security**: JWT authentication, role-based access control, data encryption

## Core Features
1. **Product Management**: CRUD operations for products, categories, pricing, bulk import/export
2. **Sales/Checkout**: Point-of-sale interface, barcode scanning, discount application, receipt generation
3. **Inventory Management**: Stock tracking, low-stock alerts, supplier ordering, stock adjustments
4. **Customer Management**: Customer database, loyalty programs, transaction history
5. **Reporting & Analytics**: Sales reports, inventory reports, profit/loss analysis, real-time dashboards
6. **Supplier Management**: Supplier database, purchase orders, delivery tracking
7. **User Management**: Multi-user support, role permissions, audit logs

## UI/UX Considerations
